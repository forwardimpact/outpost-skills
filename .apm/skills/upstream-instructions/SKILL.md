Use when CLAUDE.md, agents, or skills have been modified, added, or removed locally and those changes should be documented for upstream.

# Upstream Instructions

Track changes to this installation's **instructions** and record them in one
root `CHANGELOG.md` so improvements can be contributed back to the upstream
monorepo. "Instructions" means all three surfaces, treated equally:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** (root) — installation-wide instructions.
- **`.claude/agents/*.md`** — agent profiles.
- **`.claude/skills/*/`** — skills (`SKILL.md` and reference files).

## Trigger

- The user asks to prepare local instruction changes for upstream contribution.
- The root `CLAUDE.md`, an agent profile, or a skill has been modified, added,
  or removed.
- The user wants to document what changed locally before syncing upstream.

## Prerequisites

- A working Outpost installation with `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, and
  `.claude/skills/`.

## Inputs

- `CLAUDE.md` — root installation instructions.
- `.claude/agents/*.md` — agent profiles.
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and reference files — skills.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (root) — the existing changelog, for what's already recorded.
- The changes made in the current working session — the source of truth for what
  changed, since the KB lives on a synced filesystem and is not
  version-controlled.

## Outputs

- `CHANGELOG.md` (root) — a **single** reverse-chronological changelog covering
  all three surfaces. There are no per-skill or per-agent changelogs.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify the changelog is upstream-ready">

- [ ] Exactly one root `CHANGELOG.md`; no stray per-skill / per-agent changelogs
      left behind.
- [ ] Every entry names its **Scope** (which surface(s) and file(s) it touched).
- [ ] Each entry has **What**, **Why**, and **Details**.
- [ ] Descriptions are specific enough for an upstream maintainer to act on (not
      "updated CLAUDE.md" / "fixed stuff").
- [ ] New skills/agents include a brief description of their purpose; removed
      ones explain why.
- [ ] Dates are the date the change was made, not guessed.
- [ ] No duplicate entries for the same change.

</do_confirm_checklist>

## Procedure

### 1. Find the last documented state

```bash
head -20 CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null   # newest date already recorded, if any
```

### 2. Identify changed instructions

Knowledge bases live on a synced filesystem, not in Git, so there is no commit
history to diff. Identify what changed from the work just done **this session**:
recall every edit, addition, removal, and rename made to `CLAUDE.md`,
`.claude/agents/`, and `.claude/skills/` during the current conversation, and
list them per surface.

Use `CHANGELOG.md` only to see what's already recorded so you don't duplicate an
existing entry. If something was clearly changed but you can't reconstruct what
or why from the session, flag it as needing review rather than guessing.

### 3. Classify each change

| Surface       | What it covers                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`   | Root installation instructions                  |
| `agent:<name>`| A profile in `.claude/agents/`                  |
| `skill:<name>`| A skill in `.claude/skills/`                    |

| Type       | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `added`    | New instruction file that doesn't exist upstream       |
| `modified` | Existing instruction updated                           |
| `removed`  | Instruction file or directory deleted                  |
| `renamed`  | File or directory renamed                              |

A single change often spans surfaces (e.g. a KB-structure change touching
`CLAUDE.md`, several agents, and several skills) — record it as **one entry**
whose Scope lists every surface touched. Re-read the affected files to confirm
the change landed as intended before describing it.

### 4. Describe each change

Every entry must answer:

1. **What changed?** — the specific instruction or behaviour modified.
2. **Why?** — the problem encountered or improvement discovered in use.
3. **Details** — a summary of the actual change (not a full diff).

Good: "Agents now read `Knowledge/Priorities/` at the start of every wake and
flag anything that threatens a priority — drafts and triage were ignoring
strategic context."

Bad: "Updated the agents" / "Fixed stuff" / "Changed line 42".

### 5. Write the changelog

Create or update the single root `CHANGELOG.md` (newest first):

```markdown
# Outpost Instructions Changelog

Changes to this installation's instructions — root `CLAUDE.md`, agent profiles
(`.claude/agents/`), and skills (`.claude/skills/`) — for consideration upstream
in the Forward Impact monorepo. Documents only; pushes nothing.

## <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Scope:** <surfaces/files, e.g. "skill: extract-entities; CLAUDE.md; agents: librarian, recruiter">
**Type:** <added | modified | removed | renamed>

**What:** <one-line summary>

**Why:** <problem or improvement that motivated it>

**Details:**
<2–6 lines describing the specific changes across the listed surfaces>

```

Worked examples in [references/examples.md](references/examples.md).

## Notes

- This skill **documents only** — it does not push or merge anything.
- The single root `CHANGELOG.md` is consumed by the **downstream-instructions**
  skill in the upstream monorepo.
- When in doubt about whether a change is upstream-worthy, include it; the
  upstream maintainer decides what to incorporate.
