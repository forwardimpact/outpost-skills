# Draft Emails

Draft and send email responses. Use the knowledge base and calendar for full
context on every person and conversation. Every draft needs explicit user
approval before you send it.

## Trigger

The user asks to draft, reply to, respond to, or send an email.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge base populated (from `extract-entities`).
- Synced email data in `~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_mail/`.

## Data locations

| Data            | Location                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| People          | `Knowledge/People/*.md`                      |
| Organizations   | `Knowledge/Organizations/*.md`               |
| Email threads   | `~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_mail/*.md`       |
| Calendar events | `~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_calendar/*.json` |
| Handled IDs     | `Drafts/handled` (one ID per line)           |
| Ignored IDs     | `Drafts/ignored` (one ID per line)           |
| Draft files     | `Drafts/{email_id}_draft.md`                 |

`handled` and `ignored` both exclude threads from `scan-emails.mjs`. Use
`handled` for resolved threads (sent here, replied manually, resolved through a
DM). Use `ignored` for threads that need no response (newsletters, spam,
outbound with no reply).

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify a draft is safe and ready before sending">

- [ ] You looked up the sender and the organization in `Knowledge/` before you
      drafted.
- [ ] The draft is a single email (not multiple variants). It matches the
      incoming tone.
- [ ] The body has no sign-off, name, or "Best". The Apple Mail signature
      handles it.
- [ ] In a recruitment thread, the candidate is excluded from internal
      recipients. Any direct-to-candidate draft carries `⚠️ RECRUITER ONLY`.
- [ ] The draft includes no sensitive personal data (health, politics, etc.).
- [ ] The user explicitly approved the draft before any send.
- [ ] Send used `--draft <path>` so cleanup and `Drafts/handled` happen
      automatically.

</do_confirm_checklist>

## Procedure

### 1. Scan for new emails

```bash
node scripts/scan-emails.mjs
```

The script outputs `email_id<TAB>subject` for unprocessed emails (those not in
`Drafts/handled` or `Drafts/ignored`).

### 2. Classify

**Ignore** (append ID to `Drafts/ignored`): newsletters, marketing, automated
notifications, spam, outbound with no reply.

**Draft a response**: meeting requests, personal mail from known contacts,
business inquiries or follow-ups, requests for information or action.

Be conservative with ignore. When in doubt, draft.

### 3. Gather context

Before you draft, look up the sender and the organization in `Knowledge/`:

```bash
rg -l "sender_name" Knowledge/
cat "Knowledge/People/Sender Name.md"
cat "Knowledge/Organizations/Company Name.md"
```

For an email that arranges a meeting time, also read the relevant calendar
event:

```bash
ls ~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_calendar/ 2>/dev/null
cat "$HOME/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_calendar/event123.json"
```

Extract role, organization, relationship history, and open items. If the intent
is unclear or the person has multiple contexts, **ask** rather than guess.

### 4. Write the draft

Save to `Drafts/{email_id}_draft.md` with the template in
[references/template.md](references/template.md). Reference past interactions
naturally. To arrange a meeting, propose specific times from the calendar
availability.

### 5. Recruitment & staffing emails

You **must never** copy candidates on internal threads about them.

- Identify the candidate from the thread and `Knowledge/Candidates/`.
- Strip the candidate from To/CC. Draft to internal stakeholders only.
- Direct-to-candidate emails carry the warning header
  `⚠️ RECRUITER ONLY — This email goes directly to the candidate.`

If a thread mentions a candidate and includes multiple internal recipients,
treat it as internal. Exclude the candidate.

### 6. Present and approve

Show the draft to the user. Wait for explicit approval before you send. Apply
edits. Present the draft again as needed.

### 7. Send

After the user approves, send the email through Apple Mail:

```bash
node scripts/send-email.mjs \
  --to "recipient@example.com" \
  --cc "other@example.com" \
  --subject "Re: Subject" \
  --body "Plain text body" \
  --draft "Drafts/12345_draft.md"
```

Required: `--to`, `--subject`, `--body` (plain text). Optional: `--cc`, `--bcc`,
`--draft`. With `--draft`, the script deletes the draft file. It also appends
the email ID to `Drafts/handled` automatically.

### 8. Mark handled and do not send

When other channels resolve a thread:

```bash
echo "$EMAIL_ID" >> Drafts/handled
rm -f "Drafts/${EMAIL_ID}_draft.md"
```
