# Changelog

Write tier: each shared tier (rank 1 and up)
Frontmatter: changelog

Record the changes to the **knowledge graph** (the tier directories) from the
current working session. Write them into one `CHANGELOG.md` per shared tier
(`<N>-<Label>/CHANGELOG.md`, ranks 1 and up), newest first. Teammates who
receive a tier can then see what changed in it and why.

The changelog is per tier because its audience is the tier's audience. An
entry never names a note in a narrower tier: a change to a tier-2 note goes
to `2-Confidential/CHANGELOG.md` only, never to `3-Team/CHANGELOG.md`.
`0-Draft/` keeps no changelog. Discover changelogs inside the tier
directories only.

This skill tracks **graph content**: the notes under each tier's entity
subdirectories (`People/`, `Organizations/`, `Projects/`, `Candidates/`, and
the rest). It does **not** track changes to instructions (`CLAUDE.md`,
agents, skills). The `upstream-instructions` skill owns those, and the root
instruction `CHANGELOG.md` is a personal surface this skill never touches.

## Trigger

- The user asks to write, update, or record a changelog after they edit the KB.
- A session added, modified, removed, or renamed notes in a shared tier. The
  user wants a record of those changes for the team.

## Inputs

- **The edits made in the current session** — the source of truth. A tier may
  sync over a mount with no version control, so never rely on commit history.
  Recall every note that you created, edited, removed, or renamed in a shared
  tier during this conversation.
- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/identity.md` — the current user's identity. Use
  its **Name** as the author on each entry. The tiers are shared, so every entry
  must name the team member who made the change. Resolve `~` to `$HOME` before
  you read it.
- `<N>-<Label>/CHANGELOG.md` per shared tier — the existing changelogs. Read
  them to see what is already recorded and to avoid duplicates.

## Outputs

- One `CHANGELOG.md` per shared tier that had changes: a
  reverse-chronological log that covers that tier's subdirectories. No
  per-folder or per-note changelogs, and none in `0-Draft/`.

## Ethics

The team shares each tier with its own audience. Every entry obeys the KB's
integrity rules: objective and factual, work-relevant, no personal judgments.
Assume the person a note is about will read its changelog entry. Describe
**what changed in the graph**. Do not record opinions about the people in it.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify the changelog is accurate and shareable">

- [ ] Keep exactly one `CHANGELOG.md` per shared tier, at the tier root.
      Leave no stray per-folder changelog and none in `0-Draft/`.
- [ ] Route every entry to the changelog of the tier that holds the changed
      note. Never name a narrower tier's note in a wider tier's changelog.
- [ ] Write every entry as **one line**: type, **Scope** (tier-prefixed
      paths), **Who**, and a short pointer. No `What:`/`Why:` blocks.
- [ ] Make the pointer specific enough to locate the change (never "updated
      some notes").
- [ ] Use the real date of each change. Never guess a date.
- [ ] Add no duplicate entry for a change already in the changelog.
- [ ] Keep every entry factual and fit for the subject to read.
- [ ] Stamp the frontmatter core (`type: changelog`, `created`, `updated`) on
      a changelog you create; stamp `updated` on one you edit.
- [ ] Keep each file short (see Step 5). Compact or drop old entries when it
      grows.

</do_confirm_checklist>

## Procedure

### 1. Find what's already recorded, and who you are

```bash
head -30 3-Team/CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null          # per tier you changed
cat "$HOME/.cache/fit/outpost/state/identity.md"  # Name → the author
```

If `identity.md` is missing or stale, run the `person-identify` skill to refresh
it before you log the changes. Never guess the author.

### 2. Reconstruct this session's changes

Recall every change you made to the shared tiers during the current
conversation: creations, edits, removals, and renames. Group them by note,
then by tier. If you are unsure that a change landed, confirm it before you
log it:

```bash
rg --files [0-9]-*/ | rg "<note name>"            # confirm a note exists
cat "3-Team/People/Doe, Jane.md"                  # confirm content landed
```

Optionally, surface anything you edited recently and might have missed:

```bash
find [0-9]-* -name '*.md' -newermt '-1 day' -not -path '*/.*'
```

Use each tier's `CHANGELOG.md` only to avoid a duplicate of an entry already
there.

### 3. Classify each change

| Type       | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `added`    | New note created                     |
| `modified` | Existing note updated                |
| `removed`  | Note deleted                         |
| `renamed`  | Note renamed or moved                |

Some related changes form one logical edit. An example is a new project note
plus the backlinks to the people it involves. Record these as **one entry**
when they live in one tier. Changes that span tiers split into one entry per
tier, each naming only that tier's notes.

### 4. Write the changelog

Create or update the changed tiers' `CHANGELOG.md` files (newest first).
Group entries under one heading per day. Write one bullet per logical change.
A new changelog opens with the frontmatter core (`type: changelog`,
`created`, `updated`); an edited one gets a fresh `updated`.

```markdown
---
type: changelog
created: 2026-01-01
updated: 2026-01-01

# Team Changelog

Terse, newest-first pointers to changes in this tier. This is a hint for
teammates who sync the same files, not a precious record. The `changelog`
skill maintains it, and compacts and drops old entries as the file grows.

## <YYYY-MM-DD>

- **<added | modified | removed | renamed>** — _<Scope: tier-prefixed path(s)>_ · <Who> — <short pointer: what changed, and why only if it isn't obvious.>
```

**Keep entries brief — a pointer, not a summary.** One line each. State the
type, the scope (tier-prefixed paths), the author, and a short clause that
lets a teammate find the change and grasp its gist. Do **not** reproduce the
content of the edit. If someone needs the detail, they open the note.

Use the real date of the change (today's date is in context). Use the **Name**
from `identity.md` as `<Who>`. The team shares the file, so the author travels
on each entry.

Collapse related same-tier edits into one line. Several notes touched for one
purpose, or the same note created-then-reworked in a session, is a single
entry. Combine the types (e.g. `**added / renamed**`) and name the notes in
the scope.

### 5. Compact each file when it grows

A changelog is a **disposable hint file, not an archive**. The notes
themselves are the record. Keep it short. After you add this session's
entries, compact the file in the same pass when it has grown large (rough
guide: **more than ~150 lines, or older than ~2 months of daily headings**):

- **Roll up old days.** Fold each day older than ~2 weeks into one or two
  thematic lines per author.
- **Merge iterative churn.** Collapse a run of edits to the same file or
  topic into a single line that describes the net result.
- **Drop the stale tail.** Delete day headings older than ~2–3 months
  outright. The change already lives in the notes.

Be aggressive: losing granularity here costs nothing. Never rewrite an entry
to say something the edit did not do. Do not drop a *recent* change just to
save space.

## Notes

- This skill **documents only**. It records changes you already made. It does
  not make or undo edits.
- One `CHANGELOG.md` per shared tier, at the tier root, never per-folder.
- For changes to instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, agents, skills), use
  `upstream-instructions` instead; its root `CHANGELOG.md` is a separate
  personal artifact.
