# Sync Teams

Write tier: none (cache only)
Frontmatter: none

Sync recent Microsoft Teams chat messages into
`~/.cache/fit/outpost/teams_chat/` as markdown files. This is an automated skill
in the data pipeline. It ingests chat data that other skills (like
`extract-entities`) consume downstream.

This skill reads the Teams IndexedDB cache directly from disk. It needs no
browser automation, no API tokens, and no network access. The Teams desktop app
uses Edge WebView2. The app stores conversations and messages in a
LevelDB-backed IndexedDB at a known location. This skill parses those files,
deserializes the V8-encoded records, and writes markdown.

## Trigger

Run this skill on a schedule (every 15 minutes) or when the user asks to sync
their Teams chats.

## Prerequisites

- macOS with the Microsoft Teams desktop app installed (`com.microsoft.teams2`)
- `snappyjs` npm package installed (`npm install snappyjs`)
- Node.js 20+ (uses `node:v8` built-in for deserialization)

## Inputs

- `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.teams2/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MSTeams/EBWebView/WV2Profile_tfw/IndexedDB/https_teams.microsoft.com_0.indexeddb.leveldb/`
  — Teams IndexedDB (LevelDB on disk)
- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/teams_last_sync` — ISO timestamp of last sync
- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/teams_chat_index.tsv` — index of known chats

## Outputs

- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/teams_chat/{slug}.md` — one markdown file per chat
  (overwritten each sync with current state)
- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/teams_last_sync` — updated with sync timestamp
- `~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/teams_chat_index.tsv` — updated chat index

---

## Implementation

Run the sync as a single Node.js script:

```text
node scripts/sync.mjs [--days N]
```

- `--days N` — only include messages from the last N days (default: 30)

The script:

1. Reads all LevelDB `.ldb` (SSTable) and `.log` (write-ahead log) files from
   the Teams IndexedDB directory
2. Decompresses Snappy-compressed blocks and deserializes V8-encoded values
   with Node's built-in `v8.deserialize()`
3. Extracts conversation records (with member lists, topics, chat type) and
   message records (with sender names, HTML content, timestamps)
4. Groups messages by conversation, filters by date window, and converts HTML
   content to plain text
5. Writes one markdown file per chat to `~/.cache/fit/outpost/teams_chat/`
6. Updates sync state (timestamp and chat index)

### Architecture

Three modules follow the same pattern as `sync-apple-mail`:

| Module                       | Purpose                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/leveldb-reader.mjs` | Parse LevelDB SSTable and WAL files. Handles Snappy decompression. No external dependencies except `snappyjs`.              |
| `scripts/idb-reader.mjs`     | Chromium IndexedDB layer. Strips Blink envelope, calls `v8.deserialize()`, classifies records as conversations or messages. |
| `scripts/sync.mjs`           | Main sync script. Reads data, groups by conversation, normalizes names, writes markdown and state.                          |

### How It Works

The Teams desktop app uses Edge WebView2 internally. WebView2 stores IndexedDB
data in LevelDB (the same way Chrome does). The key databases are:

- **conversation-manager** — stores conversation metadata: ID, type (Chat vs
  Thread), members, topic, last message time
- **replychain-manager** — stores actual messages: sender display name, HTML
  content, timestamps, reactions, edit status

LevelDB is an append-only format. So you can read the files while Teams runs.
Newer `.ldb` files supersede older ones for the same records.

### Name Resolution

Teams conversation records do not store human-readable member names. They store
orgid identifiers only. Resolve display names from:

1. **Conversation topic** (for named group chats)
2. **Message sender names** (`imDisplayName` field) — a 1:1 chat takes the name
   of the other participant(s)

## Output Format

Each `{slug}.md` file follows the same format as the previous browser-based
implementation:

**1:1 chat:**

```markdown
# Chat with {First Last}

**Platform:** Microsoft Teams
**Last Synced:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

---

### {Sender First Last}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}

{message content}

---
```

**Group chat:**

```markdown
# Chat: {Topic} (group)

**Platform:** Microsoft Teams
**Type:** Group chat
**Participants:** {Name1}, {Name2}, ...
**Last Synced:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

---

### {Sender First Last}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}

{message content}
```

Key conventions:

- Messages in **chronological order** (oldest first)
- **Normalize names** from Teams format ("Last, First") to "First Last"
- The **Platform** line distinguishes Teams from email downstream
- **Plain text only** — the script strips HTML. Mentions stay as plain text
- **The script does not extract attachments** — it drops files and images from
  the markdown. SharePoint or OneDrive hosts them. The local cache does not. But
  the user **often downloads them manually**, so an attachment usually exists
  under `~/Downloads/` with the **same file name** Teams shows. When a message
  references an attachment and you need its contents, look there first.
- Skip system messages (calls, member adds/removes, topic changes)

## Error Handling

- Teams app not installed → report and stop
- IndexedDB directory missing → report and stop
- LevelDB file parse error → skip that file, continue with others
- V8 deserialization failure → skip that record, continue
- Snappy decompression failure → skip that block, continue
- Empty chat (no messages in window) → skip, do not write a file
- Always update sync state, even on partial success

## Constraints

- **Read-only.** The script never writes to the Teams IndexedDB or sends
  messages.
- **Cache-dependent.** Only the conversations Teams caches locally are
  available. This covers recently viewed chats. It does not cover full history.
- **Both 1:1 and group chats.** The script syncs both and excludes channels.
- **No message limit per chat** — the output holds every cached message within
  the `--days` window.

## Limitations

- The IndexedDB is a **cache**. It is not an archive. Only the conversations the
  user opened recently in Teams have cached message data. An older conversation
  the user never opened may have conversation metadata but no messages.
- If you clear the Teams cache (a common troubleshooting step), all local data
  goes away until Teams rebuilds it from the server.
- Some V8-serialized records (~17% in tests) use formats that `v8.deserialize()`
  cannot decode. The script skips them silently. They are typically IndexedDB
  metadata. They are not conversation or message records.
- **The script never syncs attachments (files/images) into the markdown** — it
  captures only the message text. The binaries live on SharePoint/OneDrive. But
  the user downloads them often, so the same-named file is usually already in
  `~/Downloads/`. Check there before you fetch from SharePoint.
