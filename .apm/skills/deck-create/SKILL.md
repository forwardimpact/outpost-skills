# Create Presentations

Generate PDF slide decks from user requests. Playwright renders the HTML slides
to PDF. This skill can pull context from the knowledge base for company info,
project details, and people.

## Trigger

Run when the user asks to create a presentation, slide deck, or pitch deck.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- The skill installs Playwright on first use

## Inputs

- User's description of the presentation
- `Knowledge/` — optional context about company, product, team, projects

## Outputs

- `~/Desktop/presentation.pdf` — the generated PDF presentation

---

## Workflow

1. Check `Knowledge/` for relevant context about the company, product, team,
   etc.
2. Make sure Playwright is installed:
   `bun install playwright && bunx playwright install chromium`
3. Create an HTML file at `/tmp/outpost-presentation.html` with slides
   (1280x720px each)
4. Include the required CSS from [references/slide.css](references/slide.css)
5. Run the conversion script:

        node scripts/convert-to-pdf.mjs

6. Tell the user: "Your presentation is ready at ~/Desktop/presentation.pdf"

**Do NOT show HTML code to the user. Just create the PDF and deliver it.**

The conversion script accepts optional arguments:

    node scripts/convert-to-pdf.mjs [input.html] [output.pdf]

Defaults: input = `/tmp/outpost-presentation.html`, output =
`~/Desktop/presentation.pdf`

## PDF Rendering Rules

**These rules prevent problems when the PDF renders:**

1. **No layered elements** — Style content elements directly. Do not add
   separate background elements
2. **No box-shadow** — Use borders instead: `border: 1px solid #e5e7eb`
3. **Bullets with CSS only** — Use `li::before` pseudo-elements
4. **Content must fit** — Slides are 1280x720px with 60px padding. The safe area
   is 1160x600px. Use `overflow: hidden`
5. **No footers or headers** — No fixed/absolute positioned footer/header
   elements

## Interactive HTML Decks — Navigation & Event Standards

You can deliver the deck as a **standalone interactive HTML file**
(animated / navigable in the browser) instead of a static PDF. Then keep the
input handlers deliberately minimal. Rich event handlers fight with two things
the user needs: selection and copy of text on a slide, and text entry into
overlay tools (e.g. the `slide-annotator.js` review overlay).

**Required:**

1. **Arrow keys are the only navigation.** `→` / `ArrowRight` = next,
   `←` / `ArrowLeft` = previous. Nothing else advances slides.
2. **No click-to-advance.** Do NOT add click regions on the slide/stage that
   navigate (e.g. "click left/right third"). They fire on the mouse-up that ends
   a text-selection drag and jump the slide unexpectedly.
3. **No spacebar, PageUp/PageDown, or other global key bindings.** Space
   conflicts when the user types into an overlay input. The rest are redundant
   and surprising.
4. **A progress indicator may be clickable**, but it must live in the
   footer/chrome and never overlap slide content.
5. **Expose `window.deckGoto(index)`** (0-based) right after the slide-show
   function, so review/overlay tools can jump to a slide without a simulated
   click or key:

        function go(n) { /* ...show slide n... */ }
        window.deckGoto = go;

6. **Keep the hint honest** — the on-screen nav hint should read
   `← → to navigate` (don't advertise click/space).
7. **Use stable structural hooks.** Make each slide one element with class
   `.slide`. Put the slide-number label (if any) in a `.slide-num` element.
   The review overlay defaults to these selectors to detect and index slides.

These rules keep decks compatible with the **`deck-review`** skill. That skill
installs the `slide-annotator.js` review overlay (highlight text on a slide →
sidecar JSON of feedback that an agent acts on). After you produce an
interactive HTML deck, you can offer to run `deck-review` to make it reviewable.
See that skill for the install steps and the sidecar JSON schema.

## Constraints

- Always use the knowledge base for context when available
- Output to `~/Desktop/presentation.pdf` unless the user specifies otherwise
- Keep slides clean and readable (max 5-6 bullet points per slide)
- Use the same styles throughout
- For interactive HTML decks, follow the navigation & event standards above
  (arrow-keys-only, no click-to-advance or spacebar)
