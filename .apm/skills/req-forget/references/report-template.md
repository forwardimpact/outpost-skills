# Erasure Report Template

Audit trail for `req-forget` Step 4. Save to
`Knowledge/Erasure/{Name}--{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

**The report itself must not contain personal data** beyond the subject's name
and the actions taken. Do not copy CV content, skills, or assessments into the
report — record only what was deleted, not what it contained.

**Scope:** {all / recruitment-only}

## Requires Manual Action

The following are outside this tool's reach:

- **Apple Mail** — original emails remain in the user's mailbox. Search
  Mail.app for "{Name}" and delete threads manually.
- **Apple Calendar** — events remain in Calendar.app.
- **Recruitment agencies** — notify {Agency} of the deletion and request
  they do the same.
- **Interview notes** — check physical notebooks and external apps.
- **Shared documents** — check Google Drive, SharePoint, etc.

## Verification

```bash
rg "{Name}" Knowledge/ ~/.cache/fit/outpost/
````

Expected: no matches except this erasure report.
