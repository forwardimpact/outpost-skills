# Right to Be Forgotten

Write tier: `2-Confidential` (erasure record; sweep every tier present)
Frontmatter: erasure

Process data erasure requests under GDPR Article 17. Work from the person's
name and every recorded alias. Sweep every tier present, the owner's personal
surfaces (`0-Draft/`, `Briefings/`), the cached synced data, and the agent
state files. Produces an **erasure report** that records what you found,
deleted, and redacted. The report is the compliance audit trail.

## Trigger

- A formal GDPR erasure request arrives.
- The user asks to delete all data about a specific person.
- A candidate withdraws and requests data deletion.
- The user asks to "forget" someone.

## Prerequisites

- The person's full name (and any known aliases or email addresses).
- User confirmation before any deletion.

## Inputs

- **Name** (required) — full name of the data subject.
- **Aliases** (optional) — alternative names, maiden names, nicknames.
- **Emails** (optional) — improves search coverage.
- **Scope** — `all` (default) or `recruitment-only`.

## Outputs

- `2-Confidential/Erasure/{Name}--{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` — erasure report.
- Deleted files and redacted references across every tier.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify erasure is complete and the audit trail is
sound">

- [ ] Get the user's confirmation before any deletion.
- [ ] Run every discovery recipe for the name and each alias. Cover every tier
      present, `Briefings/`, cache, and state in the inventory.
- [ ] Delete all dedicated files and directories.
- [ ] Redact all mentions and backlinks from other notes.
- [ ] Handle cached email threads, attachments, and calendar entries.
- [ ] Clean the agent state and `graph_processed`.
- [ ] Save the erasure report. Keep **no** personal data in it beyond the name
      and the actions taken.
- [ ] Run a final `rg` search. Confirm the erasure report is the only match.
- [ ] Run `npx fit-outpost validate` on the KB root. Fix the dangles the
      removal created.

## Procedure

### 0. Confirm intent

State to the user:

> **Data erasure request for: {Name}**
>
> This will permanently delete all personal data related to {Name} from:
>
> - Notes in every tier (People, Candidates, Organizations mentions)
> - Personal surfaces (`0-Draft/`, `Briefings/`)
> - Cached email threads and attachments
> - Agent state and triage files
>
> You cannot undo this action. Proceed?

**Wait for explicit confirmation before you continue.**

### 1. Discovery

Read the subject's frontmatter `aliases` first. Run every recipe in
[references/locations.md](references/locations.md) for the name, each alias,
and each email. Compile a complete inventory of every file and reference
found.

### 2. Classify

For each match, pick an action from the table in
[references/classify.md](references/classify.md). Apply its redaction rules
where redaction is the action.

### 3. Execute deletions

Process most-specific to most-general.

**3a. Dedicated files and directories (repeat per tier present):**

```bash
rm -rf "2-Confidential/Candidates/{Name}/"
rm -f "2-Confidential/People/{Name}.md"   # overlay note
rm -f "3-Team/People/{Name}.md"
find ~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_mail/attachments/ -iname "*{Name}*" -delete
```

**3b. Redact mentions in other notes:** Read each file. Remove the specific
lines/bullets/sections per the rules in
[references/classify.md](references/classify.md#redaction-rules). Remove broken
`[[backlinks]]` to deleted notes. Write the file back.

**3c. Email threads:** Delete sole-subject threads. Redact paragraphs only in
multi-person threads.

**3d. Agent state files:**

```bash
for f in ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/*_triage.md; do
  if rg -q "{Name}" "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    rg -v "{Name}" "$f" > "$f.tmp" && mv "$f.tmp" "$f"
  fi
done
```

**3e. Processing state:** drop deleted paths from `graph_processed`:

```bash
rg -v "{deleted_path}" ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed \
  > ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed.tmp \
  && mv ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed.tmp \
       ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed
```

### 4. Write the erasure report

Use the template in
[references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md). Save to
`2-Confidential/Erasure/{Name}--{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. Record **only** what you
deleted. Never record CV content, skills, or assessments.

### 5. Verify

Run from the KB root so the search covers every tier and personal surface:

```bash
rg "{Name}" . ~/.cache/fit/outpost/
```

The only match should be the erasure report. If other matches remain, process
them and update the report. Repeat for each alias and email. Then validate the
graph. The removal creates dangling links. Fix what the validator reports:

```bash
npx fit-outpost validate {kb-root}
```

## Scope variants

**`recruitment-only`** limits erasure to:

- `2-Confidential/Candidates/{Name}/`
- `2-Confidential/Candidates/Insights.md` mentions
- Recruitment threads (known agency domains)
- `recruiter_triage.md`

It leaves `3-Team/People/{Name}.md` and the wider graph intact. The person
may be a colleague or a non-recruitment contact.

**`all`** (default): full erasure across every tier, personal surfaces, cache,
and state.
