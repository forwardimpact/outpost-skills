# Right to Be Forgotten

Process data erasure requests under GDPR Article 17. Work from the person's
name. Systematically find and remove all personal data from the knowledge base,
the cached synced data, and the agent state files. Produces an **erasure
report** that records what you found, deleted, and redacted. The report is the
compliance audit trail.

## Trigger

- A formal GDPR erasure request arrives.
- The user asks to delete all data about a specific person.
- A candidate withdraws and requests data deletion.
- The user asks to "forget" someone.

## Prerequisites

- The person's full name (and any known aliases or email addresses).
- User confirmation before any deletion.

## Inputs

- **Name** (required) — full name of the data subject.
- **Aliases** (optional) — alternative names, maiden names, nicknames.
- **Emails** (optional) — improves search coverage.
- **Scope** — `all` (default) or `recruitment-only`.

## Outputs

- `Knowledge/Erasure/{Name}--{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` — erasure report.
- Deleted files and redacted references across the knowledge base.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify erasure is complete and the audit trail is
sound">

- [ ] Get the user's confirmation before any deletion.
- [ ] Run every discovery recipe. Cover knowledge, cache, state, and drafts in
      the inventory.
- [ ] Delete all dedicated files and directories.
- [ ] Redact all mentions and backlinks from other notes.
- [ ] Handle cached email threads, attachments, and calendar entries.
- [ ] Clean the agent state and `graph_processed`.
- [ ] Save the erasure report. Keep **no** personal data in it beyond the name
      and the actions taken.
- [ ] Run a final `rg` search. Confirm the erasure report is the only match.

## Procedure

### 0. Confirm intent

State to the user:

> **Data erasure request for: {Name}**
>
> This will permanently delete all personal data related to {Name} from:
>
> - Knowledge base notes (People, Candidates, Organizations mentions)
> - Cached email threads and attachments
> - Agent state and triage files
>
> You cannot undo this action. Proceed?

**Wait for explicit confirmation before you continue.**

### 1. Discovery

Run every recipe in [references/locations.md](references/locations.md) and
compile a complete inventory of every file and reference found.

### 2. Classify

For each match, pick an action from the table in
[references/classify.md](references/classify.md). Apply its redaction rules
where redaction is the action.

### 3. Execute deletions

Process most-specific to most-general.

**3a. Dedicated files and directories:**

```bash
rm -rf "Knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/"
rm -f "Knowledge/People/{Name}.md"
find ~/.cache/fit/outpost/apple_mail/attachments/ -iname "*{Name}*" -delete
```

**3b. Redact mentions in other notes:** Read each file. Remove the specific
lines/bullets/sections per the rules in
[references/classify.md](references/classify.md#redaction-rules). Remove broken
`[[backlinks]]` to deleted notes. Write the file back.

**3c. Email threads:** Delete sole-subject threads. Redact paragraphs only in
multi-person threads.

**3d. Agent state files:**

```bash
for f in ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/*_triage.md; do
  if rg -q "{Name}" "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    rg -v "{Name}" "$f" > "$f.tmp" && mv "$f.tmp" "$f"
  fi
done
```

**3e. Processing state:** drop deleted paths from `graph_processed`:

```bash
rg -v "{deleted_path}" ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed \
  > ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed.tmp \
  && mv ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed.tmp \
       ~/.cache/fit/outpost/state/graph_processed
```

### 4. Write the erasure report

Use the template in
[references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md). Save to
`Knowledge/Erasure/{Name}--{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. Record **only** what you deleted.
Never record CV content, skills, or assessments.

### 5. Verify

```bash
rg "{Name}" Knowledge/ ~/.cache/fit/outpost/ Drafts/
```

The only match should be the erasure report. If other matches remain, process
them and update the report.

## Scope variants

**`recruitment-only`** limits erasure to:

- `Knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/`
- `Knowledge/Candidates/Insights.md` mentions
- Recruitment threads (known agency domains)
- `recruiter_triage.md`

It leaves `Knowledge/People/{Name}.md` and the wider graph intact. The person
may be a colleague or a non-recruitment contact.

**`all`** (default): full erasure across knowledge base, cache, and state.
